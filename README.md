Meet our teams, choose what you are willing to create and [apply here!](https://forms.gle/KAprENxFE8PnfaUKA)

## Lore Team
Here we use words and sentences as sharp weapons and plated armor, we create the very fabric of the narrative, enjoying flow of the ideas, detailing locations with dialogues opportunities and quests and script those NPC!
Join us for positions:
- D&I Writer/Scripter - You will be at very logic of quests, you'll be scripting NPC with close-range dialogues, custom UI texts, creating custom artifacts and overall work on dungeons locations and immersivness of the world through texts and images, concept arts and sketches! 
- Lore Writer - You will be the one who will assess, reproduce and distill text for Mythic Realms and create your very own literature in-game and on Wiki page. The best part of it: you will be the only group that will know what's going to happen next in this game through texts.
- Website Content Creator - This is very important role! If you like to write small Journal/Blogger posts about what's going on, spread news and actively support the server, this position is for you!

## Code Team
Hello there! ;) We are the Jedis of the code and functions, we create the logic and the circuits of smooth and stable gameplay, we provide support for our custom plugins and contribute towards community of fellow developers! 
Join us for positions:
### Developers
- Plugin Developer - You know your way with Java or Bukkit API? You wrote some plugins way before? How about writing a plugin that will cover almost every essense of this server? Sounds interesting? Apply!
### Scripters
- Quest Scripter - You are the one to work closely with everyone in the team. You are a final stroke, before we start running tests - you're a quest scripter. You will process and divide logically and naturally Quest Archs, PvE Quests and PvP Quests, and script them into our Quest plugin system. Wanna be a part of the team?
- General Scripter - You are the one who will script general zones, close-ranged music boxes, dungeons with writers! It's pretty much of work and we are looking for a tight group here.
### Operators
- Plugin Operator - This one is under consideration, we will come back later to this position!
- CommandBlock Operator - Command blocks? Fun! Unleash your knowledge and power and create massive puzzles in quest zones and dungeons, make walls, floors and ceiling move around the player to disorient him or create a maze with ever shifting walls. It's totally up to you, to design those mazes and puzzles within quest locations!

## Game Team
We are the grand opening and grand finale of the game, we do the environment of the game on it's early stages and continuously developing new zones and areas of interest! 
Join us for positions:
### Architects
- Landscape Architect - Hey, do you know VoxelSniper and know WE commands like your five fingers? We might have a place for you to unleash your magic! We would like to see a mid-experienced landscaper to join our efforts! We have absolutely ready map and we need some over-the-shoulder eye on things. You will be using your powers mainly to do slight alterations, except if there is a need for river with custom shaped riverbed! Apply if you feel like you can handle this! 
- Urban Builder - As the name says, you are builder who works on districts and towns, villages and hamlets, every place that massively inhabited by any civilization would be your field of exertise. Ever wanted to have massive workspace? Apply know, there are rumors that we have whole planet in development ;)
- Wilderness Builder - You are the ruler of forests, lodges, dungeons and caves. You will be creating the mystery of the wild, savage approach to things. A house on a tree for a witch? Or perhaps a secluded lair of a Troll? Anything is possible and depends only on your skills. Wanna try it?
### Operators
- Environment Operator - You are one of those guys who create something else, you are lead and head of any zone you chose to develop, you are there when the builders have no ideas, you work closely with Lore Team to provide concept art, you design a plan if it's a city, a sketch if it's a zone with sole building. Anything will do, apply here if you are able to explain others what you want to see at this location!
